# CUBA - Control for UAS Based on Accelerometers
This is a flight control system for drones based on voluntary hand movements captured by using accelerometers. The resulting system is much more intuitive than conventional means, as well as it allows a high manoeuvrability. The software is composed by three clearly different parts: 

* Acceleration-data acquisition
* Movement detection
* Commands transfer to the drone
